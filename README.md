## MySQL/MariaDB/Percona Auto-Сlustering with Embedded Load Balancing and Replication Types Selection

MySQL/MariaDB/Percona Auto-Clustering solution is packaged as an advanced highly available and auto-scalable cluster on top of managed dockerized stack templates.

</p>

The package includes Highly Available [*ProxySQL Load Balancer*](http://www.proxysql.com) and [*Cluster Orchestrator*](https://github.com/github/orchestrator) to manage MySQL/MariaDB/Percona replication topology. And there is a choice between different MySQL/MariaDB/Percona replication types:

## Simple MySQL/MariaDB/Percona Replication

* *primary*-*secondary*(*source*-*replica*) - provides a good consistency (i.e. exactly one node to modify data), but no automatic failover upon primary failure. Secondaries can be read without impact on primary. This topology is previously known as *master-slave*
* *primary*-*primary*(*source*-*source*) - operates with two primary nodes simultaneously, while other instances are configured as secondaries. This topology is previously known as *master-master*

## MariaDB Galera Cluster

[MariaDB Galera Cluster](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/what-is-mariadb-galera-cluster/) is a type of multi-master synchronous replication which is performed at a transaction commit time, by broadcasting transaction write set to all cluster nodes for applying with the following benefits:

* No secondary lag
* No lost transactions
* Both read and write scalability
* Smaller client latencies

## Percona XtraDB Cluster

[Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtradb-cluster) (PXC) is a solution for high availability and scalability for MySQL clustering. In a nutshell, it is the Percona implementation of Galera Cluster for MySQL. PXC comes with XtraDB storage engine (a drop-in replacement of InnoDB) and follows the upstream Oracle MySQL releases very closely with the following benefits:

* No secondary lag
* No lost transactions
* Both read and write scalability
* Smaller client latencies

## Installation Process

In the opened confirmation window at VAP dashboard, choose MariaDB/MySQL/Percona replication type with appropriate cluster topology, state the *Environment* name, optionally, customize its [Display Name](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-aliases). Then, select the preferable [region](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-regions) (if several are available) and click on **Install**.
